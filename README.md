Project Title: Arithmetic Expression Parser

Description:
This project implements an arithmetic expression parser in Python. The parser is capable of parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions according to a specified Context-Free Grammar (CFG). It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, as well as parentheses for grouping expressions.

Features:
- Tokenization of input arithmetic expressions based on grammar rules.
- Lexical analysis to handle whitespace, comments, and irrelevant characters gracefully.
- Parsing of arithmetic expressions using a LL(1) parsing algorithm.
- Object-oriented design principles for modularity and extensibility.
- Comprehensive documentation explaining grammar rules and implementation details.

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/arithmetic-expression-parser.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd arithmetic-expression-parser
   ```

Usage:
1. Run the main script to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter an arithmetic expression when prompted.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
